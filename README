README for Filter::CBC 0.05

WHATIS

Filter::CBC is a Perl Source Filter that uses CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) to 
encrypt/decrypt your sourcecode during runtime.

It uses the Filter module by Paul Marquess and Crypt::CBC by Lincoln Stein.


INSTALLING

Filter::CBC can be installed easily by using the CPAN module.

perl -MCPAN -e"install Filter::CBC"

or manually by untarring the archive and running the following commands.

    perl Makefile.PM
    make
    make test
    make install

    
TESTING

This module has been tested on Linux 2.2.x (x86) with Perl 5.005_03.


EXAMPLES & SCRIPTS

Examples are included for all the CBC compatible encryption routines.

The code2cbc.pl script can encrypt your code by asking a number of simple
questions. The autoencryption feature does the same thing, without the
questions. code2cbc.pl can be found in the obsolete directory.

The cbc2code.pl script can decrypt encrypted scripts.


AUTOFILTER

Filter::CBC can now encrypt your source code on the fly (similar to
Acme::Bleach). Just add 

use Filter::CBC 'Rijndael','my secret key','hex';

above the chunk you want to encrypt et voila.
Change the use statement according to your requirements and run it.
Filter::CBC will now encrypt the source and exit. Your code will not
be executed at that time. PLEASE backup your code before running it.
PRETTY PLEASE.
